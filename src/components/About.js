<h1>Hello! My name is Linh.</h1>
    <p class="text-light h5">
    I have been a nurse for almost 4 years now. I love helping people and working as an nurse I see a lot of changes
    that go on with our EPIC system. With that, I wanted to learn what goes in creating EPIC 
    as well as the user side. When I talk about the user side, I am talking about the webpages where the patients go 
    to find information. As healthcare moves to more virtual visits, creating websites that is user friendly
    is very important especially for the elderly. When working with these elderly patients, many of them do not know how to navigate 
    to their information online. Many of them note that it is too hard to navigate or they do not know where to start. 
    As a healthcare worker, I want to figure out ways to make things more easily accessible.
